# EMU Starfish System - Lambda & API Gateway Prompts

## Sample Prompt: Complete API Backend
```
Create a Python Lambda function that handles student flag submissions through API Gateway. The function should accept POST requests with student information and flag details, validate the input, store data in DynamoDB, and return appropriate success/error responses. Include CORS headers and error handling for common issues like missing fields or database errors.
