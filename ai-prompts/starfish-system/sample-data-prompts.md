## Sample Prompt: Test Data Generation
```
Create a Python script that generates realistic test data for a student flagging system. Generate sample student records with realistic names, IDs, and flag submissions (both support needs and kudos). Include various flag types, submission dates over the past semester, and different submitter roles (faculty, advisors, staff). Export as JSON format suitable for DynamoDB import.
