# Academic Success Predictor - Data Generation Prompts

## Sample Prompt 1: Basic Student Dataset
```
Create a Python script that generates realistic synthetic student data similar to what's found in Canvas LMS. Include student ID, demographics, GPA, assignment scores, and engagement metrics like login frequency. Generate data for 500 students and save as CSV format suitable for SageMaker Canvas. Include realistic correlations between variables.
```

## Sample Prompt 2: Upload Data to S3
```
Create a Python script that generates synthetic student academic data and uploads it to an S3 bucket. The script should include error handling, create appropriate folder structure, and validate the data before upload. Make it configurable for different bucket names and data sizes.
