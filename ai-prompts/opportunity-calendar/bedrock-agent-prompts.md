# Campus Opportunity Calendar - Bedrock Agent Prompts

## Sample Prompt: Event Extraction Agent
```
Create a Bedrock Agent configuration that can extract educational opportunity information from a Knowledge Base and populate a DynamoDB table. The agent should identify event titles, dates, descriptions, and URLs from crawled web content, filter for future events only, and store structured data. Include the agent's action group definition and Lambda function code.
