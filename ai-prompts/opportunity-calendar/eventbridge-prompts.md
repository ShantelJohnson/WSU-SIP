# Campus Opportunity Calendar - EventBridge Prompts

## Sample Prompt: Weekly Automation
```
Create an EventBridge rule that triggers weekly to refresh the opportunity calendar system. Include the rule configuration, target Lambda function that initiates the Knowledge Base sync, and error handling for failed executions. The system should automatically discover new educational opportunities and update the DynamoDB table every Sunday at 6 AM.
