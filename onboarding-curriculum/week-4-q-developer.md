## Self-Paced Learning - S3 to DynamoDB Metadata Challenge!
In this exercise, you will build a serverless application that automatically extracts metadata from files uploaded to Amazon S3 and stores this information in Amazon DynamoDB. This represents a common pattern in cloud applications where object storage events trigger downstream processing.
Learning Objectives
-	Create and configure AWS resources (S3, DynamoDB, Lambda)
-	Complete a partially implemented Lambda function
-	Set up event-driven workflows using S3 event notifications
-	Use generative AI to help solve coding problems
