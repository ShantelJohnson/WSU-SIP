# Week 4: AI-Assisted Development with Q Developer

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Set up and configure Amazon Q Developer
- Write effective prompts for code generation
- Use Q Developer for AWS-specific development tasks
- Build a complete mini-application using AI assistance
- Troubleshoot and debug AI-generated code

## Instructor-Led Session (2 hours)

### Part 1: Q Developer Intro (20 minutes)
- **What is Amazon Q Developer?**
- **AI coding assistant capabilities**
- **Integration with IDEs and AWS Console**

### Part 2: Prompt Engineering for Code (30 minutes)
- **Effective prompt structure**
- **AWS-specific prompting techniques**
- **Iterative prompt refinement**

### Break (10 minutes)

### Part 3: Q Developer Setup & Exploration (40 minutes)
- **Installation and configuration**
- **Authentication setup**
- **Hands-on exploration of capabilities**

### Part 4: Assignment Review (20 minutes)
- **Review self-paced learning assignment**
- **Q&A**

## Self-Paced Learning

### Required Activities
- **Setup Budget Alerts for your AWS account (20 minutes):** https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-create.html 
- **Q Developer - Accelerate Building Lambda Functions:** https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/2c7b3627-a1f8-4310-8e5b-211b306d10d9/en-US/lab5 
- **Build a "simple" web app**

## Mini-Project Specifications

### Student Directory System
**Functionality:**
- Store student information (ID, name, major, year)
- Search students by name or major
- Display results in web interface

**Technical Requirements:**
- DynamoDB table with appropriate schema
- Lambda function with proper error handling
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend
- All code generated using Q Developer prompts

**Success Criteria:**
- Application deploys without errors
- Search functionality works correctly
- Code is well-commented and understandable
- Student can explain how each component works

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### When Q Developer Code Doesn't Work:
1. **Check the error message** - paste it back to Q Developer
2. **Simplify the request** - break complex tasks into smaller parts
3. **Add more context** - specify AWS region, service versions, etc.
4. **Ask for explanations** - "Explain what this code does step by step"

### When Code is Too Complex:
1. **Request simpler version** - "Make this easier for a beginner"
2. **Ask for alternatives** - "Show me a different way to do this"
3. **Break it down** - "Split this into separate functions"

## Key Takeaways
- Q Developer is a powerful tool, but you need to understand the generated code
- Good prompts lead to better code - be specific and iterative
- Always test generated code incrementally
- AI assistance accelerates development but doesn't replace understanding
- The combination of AWS knowledge + AI assistance is extremely powerful

## Preparation for Project Phase
Students should now be ready to:
- Choose their project team and preferred project
- Use the AI prompts package effectively
- Build AWS applications with confidence
- Troubleshoot issues independently
